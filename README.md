# SpringBoot Web Application

The goal of this personal project is to build a web application using the popular Java framework, SpringBoot.
This project allows me to learn frameworks and concepts that are widely used in the industry but were not taught during my studies. I want to prove that I can master them nonetheless.
I am learning everything from scratch, without any prior knowledge of SpringBoot or other similar frameworks.

## What frameworks, concepts and tools did I learn?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of everything I am learning during this project:
- SpringBoot (Back-end framework + REST API)
- Maven (Build automation and dependency management tool)
- Hibernate (Object-relational mapping framework for database interactions)
- PostgreSQL (Relational database management system)
- RESTful APIs (API design style for communication between client and server)
- Vue.js (Front-end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces)
- curl (Command-line tool for testing and sending HTTP requests)

## How to run?

Use `mvn spring-boot:run` from the root folder.
Once the (Tomcat) server is running, visit `http://localhost:8080` to use the web application
or use `curl` in a terminal to make HTTP requests to the server.
