# SpringBoot Web Application

The goal of this personal project is to build a web application using the popular Java framework, SpringBoot.
This project allows me to learn frameworks and concepts that are widely used in the industry but were not taught during my studies. I want to prove that I can master them nonetheless.
I am learning everything from scratch, without any prior knowledge of SpringBoot or other similar frameworks.

## What frameworks, concepts and tools did I learn?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of everything I am learning during this project:
- SpringBoot
- Maven
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL
- RESTful APIs
- Vue.js
- curl (for testing the API)

## How to run?

Use `mvn spring-boot:run` from the root folder.
Once the (Tomcat) server is running, visit `http://localhost:8080` to use the web application
or use `curl` to make HTTP requests to the server.
